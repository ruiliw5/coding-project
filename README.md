CIFAR-10 is a dataset that consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6000 images per class: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. The image below includes one representative image for each class. 
Designed and implemented machine learning models (KNN, logistic regression) and deep learning architectures (feedforward and convolutional neural networks) to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving a test accuracy of 41.29%.
